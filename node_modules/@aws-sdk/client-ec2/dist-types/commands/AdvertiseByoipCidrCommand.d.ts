/**
 * <p>Advertises an IPv4 or IPv6 address range that is provisioned for use with your Amazon Web Services resources through
 *          bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP).</p>
 *          <p>You can perform this operation at most once every 10 seconds, even if you specify different
 *          address ranges each time.</p>
 *          <p>We recommend that you stop advertising the BYOIP CIDR from other locations when you advertise
 *           it from Amazon Web Services. To minimize down time, you can configure your Amazon Web Services resources to use an address from a
 *          BYOIP CIDR before it is advertised, and then simultaneously stop advertising it from the current
 *          location and start advertising it through Amazon Web Services.</p>
 *          <p>It can take a few minutes before traffic to the specified addresses starts routing to Amazon Web Services
 *          because of BGP propagation delays.</p>
 *          <p>To stop advertising the BYOIP CIDR, use <a>WithdrawByoipCidr</a>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EC2Client, AdvertiseByoipCidrCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ec2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EC2Client, AdvertiseByoipCidrCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ec2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EC2Client(config);
 * const command = new AdvertiseByoipCidrCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link AdvertiseByoipCidrCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link AdvertiseByoipCidrCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EC2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for EC2Client's `config` shape.
