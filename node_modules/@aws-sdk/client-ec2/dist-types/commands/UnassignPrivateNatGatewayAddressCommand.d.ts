/**
 * <p>Unassigns secondary private IPv4 addresses from a private NAT gateway. You cannot unassign your primary private IP. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html#nat-gateway-edit-secondary">Edit secondary IP address associations</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <p>While unassigning is in progress, you cannot assign/unassign additional IP addresses while the connections are being drained. You are, however, allowed to delete the NAT gateway.</p>
 *          <p>A private IP address will only be released at the end of MaxDrainDurationSeconds. The
 *             private IP addresses stay associated and support the existing connections but do not
 *             support any new connections (new connections are distributed across the remaining
 *             assigned private IP address). After the existing connections drain out, the private IP
 *             addresses get released. </p>
 *          <p></p>
 *          <p></p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EC2Client, UnassignPrivateNatGatewayAddressCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ec2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EC2Client, UnassignPrivateNatGatewayAddressCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ec2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EC2Client(config);
 * const command = new UnassignPrivateNatGatewayAddressCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link UnassignPrivateNatGatewayAddressCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link UnassignPrivateNatGatewayAddressCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EC2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for EC2Client's `config` shape.
