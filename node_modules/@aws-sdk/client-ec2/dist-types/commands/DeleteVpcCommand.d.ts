 * <p>Deletes the specified VPC. You must detach or delete all gateways and resources that are associated with the VPC before you can delete it. For example, you must terminate all instances running in the VPC, delete all security groups associated with the VPC (except the default one), delete all route tables associated with the VPC (except the default one), and so on.</p>

 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript

 * // const { EC2Client, DeleteVpcCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ec2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EC2Client(config);
 * const command = new DeleteVpcCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
