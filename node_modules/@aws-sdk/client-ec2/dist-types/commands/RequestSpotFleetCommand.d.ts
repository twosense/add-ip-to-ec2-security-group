/**
 * <p>Creates a Spot Fleet request.</p>
 *          <p>The Spot Fleet request specifies the total target capacity and the On-Demand target
 *             capacity. Amazon EC2 calculates the difference between the total capacity and On-Demand
 *             capacity, and launches the difference as Spot capacity.</p>
 *          <p>You can submit a single request that includes multiple launch specifications that vary
 *             by instance type, AMI, Availability Zone, or subnet.</p>
 *          <p>By default, the Spot Fleet requests Spot Instances in the Spot Instance pool where the
 *             price per unit is the lowest. Each launch specification can include its own instance
 *             weighting that reflects the value of the instance type to your application
 *             workload.</p>
 *          <p>Alternatively, you can specify that the Spot Fleet distribute the target capacity
 *             across the Spot pools included in its launch specifications. By ensuring that the Spot
 *             Instances in your Spot Fleet are in different Spot pools, you can improve the
 *             availability of your fleet.</p>
 *          <p>You can specify tags for the Spot Fleet request and instances launched by the fleet.
 *             You cannot tag other resource types in a Spot Fleet request because only the
 *                 <code>spot-fleet-request</code> and <code>instance</code> resource types are
 *             supported.</p>
 *          <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html">Spot Fleet requests</a>
 *             in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>We strongly discourage using the RequestSpotFleet API because it is a legacy
 *                 API with no planned investment. For options for requesting Spot Instances, see
 *                 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-best-practices.html#which-spot-request-method-to-use">Which
 *                     is the best Spot request method to use?</a> in the
 *                 <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          </important>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EC2Client, RequestSpotFleetCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ec2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EC2Client, RequestSpotFleetCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ec2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EC2Client(config);
 * const command = new RequestSpotFleetCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link RequestSpotFleetCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link RequestSpotFleetCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EC2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for EC2Client's `config` shape.
