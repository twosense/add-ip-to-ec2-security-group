/**
 * <p>Creates a VPN connection between an existing virtual private gateway or transit
 *             gateway and a customer gateway. The supported connection type is
 *             <code>ipsec.1</code>.</p>
 *          <p>The response includes information that you need to give to your network administrator
 *             to configure your customer gateway.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>We strongly recommend that you use HTTPS when calling this operation because the
 *                 response contains sensitive cryptographic information for configuring your customer
 *                 gateway device.</p>
 *          </important>
 *          <p>If you decide to shut down your VPN connection for any reason and later create a new
 *             VPN connection, you must reconfigure your customer gateway with the new information
 *             returned from this call.</p>
 *          <p>This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than once, Amazon
 *             EC2 doesn't return an error.</p>
 *          <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html">Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN
 *                 User Guide</i>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EC2Client, CreateVpnConnectionCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ec2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EC2Client, CreateVpnConnectionCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ec2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EC2Client(config);
 * const command = new CreateVpnConnectionCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateVpnConnectionCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateVpnConnectionCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EC2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for EC2Client's `config` shape.
