/**
 * <p>Deletes the specified EC2 Fleet.</p>
 *          <p>After you delete an EC2 Fleet, it launches no new instances.</p>
 *          <p>You must specify whether a deleted EC2 Fleet should also terminate its instances. If you
 *          choose to terminate the instances, the EC2 Fleet enters the <code>deleted_terminating</code>
 *          state. Otherwise, the EC2 Fleet enters the <code>deleted_running</code> state, and the instances
 *          continue to run until they are interrupted or you terminate them manually.</p>
 *          <p>For <code>instant</code> fleets, EC2 Fleet must terminate the instances when the fleet is
 *          deleted. A deleted <code>instant</code> fleet with running instances is not
 *          supported.</p>
 *          <p class="title">
 *             <b>Restrictions</b>

 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>You can delete up to 25 <code>instant</code> fleets in a single request. If you exceed this
 *                number, no <code>instant</code> fleets are deleted and an error is returned. There is no
 *                restriction on the number of fleets of type <code>maintain</code> or <code>request</code> that can be deleted
 *                in a single request.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Up to 1000 instances can be terminated in a single request to delete
 *                <code>instant</code> fleets.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>

 * // const { EC2Client, DeleteFleetsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ec2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EC2Client(config);
 * const command = new DeleteFleetsCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteFleetsCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteFleetsCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EC2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for EC2Client's `config` shape.
