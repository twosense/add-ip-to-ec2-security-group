 * <note>
 *             <p>We are retiring EC2-Classic. We recommend that you migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC.

 *          </note>
 *          <p>Describes the ClassicLink DNS support status of one or more VPCs. If enabled, the DNS
 *             hostname of a linked EC2-Classic instance resolves to its private IP address when
 *             addressed from an instance in the VPC to which it's linked. Similarly, the DNS hostname
 *             of an instance in a VPC resolves to its private IP address when addressed from a linked
 *             EC2-Classic instance. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/vpc-classiclink.html">ClassicLink</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EC2Client, DescribeVpcClassicLinkDnsSupportCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ec2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EC2Client, DescribeVpcClassicLinkDnsSupportCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ec2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EC2Client(config);
 * const command = new DescribeVpcClassicLinkDnsSupportCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DescribeVpcClassicLinkDnsSupportCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DescribeVpcClassicLinkDnsSupportCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EC2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for EC2Client's `config` shape.
