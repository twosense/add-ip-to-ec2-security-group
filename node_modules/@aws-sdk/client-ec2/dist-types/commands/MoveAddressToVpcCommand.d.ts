/**
 * <p>Moves an Elastic IP address from the EC2-Classic platform to the EC2-VPC platform. The
 *       Elastic IP address must be allocated to your account for more than 24 hours, and it must not
 *       be associated with an instance. After the Elastic IP address is moved, it is no longer
 *       available for use in the EC2-Classic platform, unless you move it back using the
 *         <a>RestoreAddressToClassic</a> request. You cannot move an Elastic IP address that was
 *       originally allocated for use in the EC2-VPC platform to the EC2-Classic platform.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>We are retiring EC2-Classic. We recommend that you migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/vpc-migrate.html">Migrate from EC2-Classic to a VPC</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EC2Client, MoveAddressToVpcCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ec2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EC2Client, MoveAddressToVpcCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ec2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EC2Client(config);
 * const command = new MoveAddressToVpcCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link MoveAddressToVpcCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link MoveAddressToVpcCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EC2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for EC2Client's `config` shape.
